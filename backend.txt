backend implimentation:

instead of the user inputing their api key, I'd have them login with standard username and password
Id, map their api in database with their user information from github (no need to enter it twice when github has it)
using the api key, I'd request fresh data only once on login, I can create a subscription service that pulls in new data periodically.
the only info that will be stored in a database however, is what the user does, so if the user doesnt click on a repository, there will be no requests made to that github api endpoint. (this is to prevent reaching rate limit early)
Its essentially like a cache that the user can save to database once they've manipulated the data by changing the order of issues, taking whats in their state interms of repo:issues, and saving it in backend.
